Genetic testing of these genes may confirm a diagnosis and help guide treatment and management decisions. Identification of a disease-causing variant would also guide testing and diagnosis of at-risk relatives. This test is specifically designed for heritable germline mutations and is not appropriate for the detection of somatic mutations in tumor tissue. PTEN: Deletion/duplication analysis covers the promoter region. ADD TO ORDER CLINICAL DESCRITPION The NGeneBio Multi-Cancer Panel analyzes 84 genes associated with hereditary cancers across several major organ systems. Individuals with a pathogenic variant in one of the genes on this panel have an increased risk of developing cancer, many of which may be difficult both to detect and to treat. Identifying those at elevated risk may guide implementation of additional screening, surveillance and interventions. These efforts may result in risk-reduction and early diagnosis, increasing the chances of successful treatment and survival. Breast cancer The average woman\u2019s lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is ~12%. Although there are a number of other genes associated with hereditary breast cancer, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) due to pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes accounts for most cases in individuals with a strong family history or early onset diagnosis. Ovarian The general population risk for ovarian cancer is ~1.3%. Lynch syndrome and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) are the most common causes of ovarian cancer. In addition, there are other genes on this panel associated with hereditary predisposition to ovarian cancer. Uterine The general population risk for uterine cancer is ~2.7%. Lynch syndrome is the most common inherited cause of uterine cancer, although there are a number of other hereditary cancer genes on this panel associated with this cancer type. Colorectal Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third-most-common cancer diagnosis in the United States. Hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes are generally divided into two types: Lynch syndrome and polyposis syndromes. Lynch syndrome, also called hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), is caused by pathogenic variants in EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 and is the most common inherited cause of colorectal cancer. Polyposis syndromes are characterized by the development of numerous precancerous polyps, which may become malignant. This panel includes genes associated with both Lynch syndrome and polyposis. Gastric Gastric cancer occurs in ~1 in 93 individuals in the general population. Gastric adenocarcinomas account for 90%\u201395% of gastric cancers and are further histologically divided into intestinal type and diffuse type. One cause of hereditary gastric cancer is a pathogenic variant in CDH1, which causes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome. However, there are a number of other genes in which pathogenic variants increase the risk of gastric tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are characterized as sarcomas and are rare tumors of the GI tract that account for 1%\u20133% of all gastric cancers. This panel includes genes that increase risk for each of these types of gastric tumors. Pancreatic There are two main types of pancreatic cancer: cancer of the exonic pancreas (pancreatic adenocarcinoma), which accounts for 95% of pancreatic tumors, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Hereditary pancreatic cancer can be caused by BRCA2 and CDKN2A, as well as by several other genes. This panel includes genes that are most commonly associated with an increased risk for both types of hereditary pancreatic cancer. Renal/urinary tract The general population risk of developing kidney cancer is ~1.6%. The lifetime risk of developing bladder cancer is 1%\u20133.8%, with approximately 75,000 new cases diagnosed in the United States each year. Most cases are sporadic and isolated, but approximately 5% of urinary tract cancers are hereditary. Unlike sporadic cases, hereditary cancers of the kidneys and urinary tract are often characterized by earlier disease onset and multifocal or bilateral tumors. Hereditary urinary tract cancers may also be syndromic and associated with other non-urinary features. Prostate Prostate cancer is the fifth-most-common malignancy in the world. A man\u2019s lifetime risk for developing this type of cancer is ~1 in 7 (15%). While most cases of prostate cancer are sporadic and not inherited, approximately 5%\u201310% of cases are hereditary. This panel includes genes that increase risk for prostate cancer. Melanoma Most cases of melanoma are isolated and sporadic. While the number of individuals who have an inherited risk of melanoma is unknown, it is thought to be low. An estimated 8% of individuals with melanoma also have a first-degree relative with melanoma and approximately 1%\u20132% of people with melanoma have two or more affected close relatives. This panel includes genes associated with a predisposition to melanoma. Thyroid Thyroid cancer occurs in ~13 per 100,000 individuals in the general population annually. The most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for over 90% of all cases, is non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC). Approximately 3%\u201310% of NMTC cases have a familial component. Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a relatively uncommon type of thyroid malignancy and is more strongly associated with hereditary cancer syndromes.The familial form of MTC accounts for 20%\u201325% of cases and is usually a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), including subtypes MEN2A and MEN2B, or presents as familial MTC (FMTC) syndrome. This panel includes genes associated with a predisposition to hereditary thyroid cancer. Paraganglioma (PGL) and pheochromocytoma (PCC) PGL are rare, adult-onset neuroendocrine tumors that may or may not be malignant. PGL can develop throughout the body, from the middle ear and skull base (called head and neck PGL, or HNP) to the adrenal glands (called pheochromocytomas (PCC)). Most cases are sporadic, but approximately one-third are familial and due to an identifiable pathogenic variant in a disease-causing gene. Familial PGL-PCC can be non-syndromic; however, it can also be a feature of an underlying condition such as neurofibromatosis type 1, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. This panel includes genes associated with hereditary PGL-PCC. Brain and nervous system (including central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) Pituitary adenoma (PA) is one of the most common types of intracranial tumors. Approximately 2% of all PA cases are attributable to FIPA (familial isolated pituitary adenoma) and the AIP gene accounts for ~20% of all FIPA cases. The general population risk for developing a CNS tumor is 0.55%\u20130.69%. PNS tumors are rare in adults and children; CNS tumors are the most common cancers among children ages 0\u201319. Approximately 5% of CNS tumors are hereditary and due to a pathogenic variant; the remainder are isolated and occur sporadically. Unlike sporadic cases, both hereditary CNS and PNS tumors may be syndromic and associated with extra-CNS features. This panel includes genes associated with hereditary predisposition to CNS and PNS tumors as well as a common cause of FIPA. Sarcoma A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that develops from a variety of connective tissues including bone, soft tissue, fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels and deep skin tissues. Sarcomas most often develop in the limbs, but they can be found in any part of the body. Most cases of sarcoma are sporadic and not inherited, but several known genetic conditions are associated with an increased risk of sarcoma. Inherited pathogenic variants in certain genes, such as those included on this panel, account for some cases of hereditary sarcoma. Individuals with pathogenic variants in these genes have an increased risk of developing sarcomas and, in some cases, other cancers as well. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/leukemia MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generally occur in the elderly population and the incidence increases with age. Cases of early onset MDS/AML in children or young adults may be associated with underlying genetic predisposition syndromes. Hereditary MDS or AML may present as part of a particular genetic syndrome that also has additional prominent clinical features. Non-syndromic familial MDS/AML is characterized by a strong family history of MDS or AML without other apparent phenotypic features. Familial occurrences of MDS/AML appear to be rare, but they may be underdiagnosed. This panel includes genes that may increase risk for MDS and leukemia. REFERENCE Hampel, H, et al.

TECHNICAL INFORMATION NGeneBio is a College of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified clinical diagnostic laboratory performing full-gene sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis using next-generation sequencing technology (NGS). Our sequence analysis covers clinically important regions of each gene, including coding exons and 10 to 20 base pairs of adjacent intronic sequence on either side of the coding exons in the transcript listed below. In addition, the analysis covers the select non-coding variants specifically defined in the table below. Any variants that fall outside these regions are not analyzed. Any limitations in the analysis of these genes will be listed on the report. Contact client services with any questions. Based on validation study results, this assay achieves >99% analytical sensitivity and specificity for single nucleotide variants, insertions and deletions <15bp in length, and exon-level deletions and duplications. NGeneBio's methods also detect insertions and deletions larger than 15bp but smaller than a full exon but sensitivity for these may be marginally reduced. NGeneBio's deletion/duplication analysis determines copy number at a single exon resolution at virtually all targeted exons. However, in rare situations, single-exon copy number events may not be analyzed due to inherent sequence properties or isolated reduction in data quality. Certain types of variants, such as structural rearrangements (e.g. inversions, gene conversion events, translocations, etc.) or variants embedded in sequence with complex architecture (e.g. short tandem repeats or segmental duplications), may not be detected. Additionally, it may not be possible to fully resolve certain details about variants, such as mosaicism, phasing, or mapping ambiguity. Unless explicitly guaranteed, sequence changes in the promoter, non-coding exons, and other non-coding regions are not covered by this assay. Please consult the test definition on our website for details regarding regions or types of variants that are covered or excluded for this test. This report reflects the analysis of an extracted genomic DNA sample. In very rare cases, (circulating hematolymphoid neoplasm, bone marrow transplant, recent blood transfusion) the analyzed DNA may not represent the patient's constitutional genome.

However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where small adjustments are necessary to preserve your brand's style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to customize a theme. In order to make a few tweaks to Material for MkDocs, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional CSS \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.css \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following line to mkdocs.yml : extra_css : - stylesheets/extra.css Spin up the live preview server and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you should see them almost instantly after saving. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in the docs directory: . \u251c\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 javascripts/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 extra.js \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, add the following line to mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript : - javascripts/extra.js Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some parts), you can extend the theme. MkDocs supports theme extension , an easy way to override parts of Material for MkDocs without forking from git. This ensures that you can update to the latest version more easily. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Enable Material for MkDocs as usual in mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides which you then reference using the custom_dir key: theme : name : material custom_dir : overrides Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, Material for MkDocs needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name parameter in mkdocs.yml . It will not work when cloning from git . The structure in the overrides directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the overrides directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the overrides directory. The directory layout of the theme is as follows: . \u251c\u2500 .icons/ # Bundled icon sets \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # Third-party integrations \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500 analytics.html # - Google Analytics \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500 disqus.html # - Disqus \u2502 \u251c\u2500 languages/ # Localized languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 logo.html # Logo in header and sidebar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 palette.html # Color palette \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-date.html # Last updated date \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source-link.html # Link to source file \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u251c\u2500 404 .html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override a partial, we can replace it with a file of the same name and location in the overrides directory. For example, to replace the original footer.html , create a footer.html file in the overrides/partials directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 footer.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding blocks \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, it's also possible to override (and extend) template blocks , which are defined inside the templates and wrap specific features. To override a block, create a main.html file inside the overrides directory: . \u251c\u2500 overrides/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500 main.html \u2514\u2500 mkdocs.yml Then, e.g. to override the site title, add the following line to main.html : {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} < title > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet </ title > {% endblock %} Material for MkDocs provides the following template blocks: Block name Wrapped contents analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration announce Wraps the announcement bar config Wraps the JavaScript application config content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the Disqus integration extrahead Empty block to add custom meta tags fonts Wraps the font definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser (if available) htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries (header) scripts Wraps the JavaScript application (footer) source Wraps the linked source files site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) tabs Wraps the tabs navigation (if available) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation . Theme development \u00b6 Material for MkDocs uses Webpack as a build tool to leverage modern web technologies like TypeScript and SASS . If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the theme and recompile it. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on Material for MkDocs, a Node.js version of at least 12 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin pip install mkdocs-redirects npm install Development mode \u00b6 Start the Webpack watchdog with: npm start Then, in a second session, start the MkDocs server with: mkdocs serve Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overridden when the theme is built. Building the theme \u00b6 When you're finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final files are located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in the original mkdocs.yml .

If you're familiar with Python, you can install Material for MkDocs with pip , the Python package manager. If not, we recommended using docker . In case you're running into problems, consult the troubleshooting section. \uc124\uce58\ud558\uae30 \u00b6 with pip \u00b6 Material for MkDocs can be installed with pip : Material for MkDocs pip install mkdocs-material Insiders pip install git+https:// ${ GH_TOKEN } @github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies: MkDocs , Markdown , Pygments and Python Markdown Extensions . Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to install those packages separately. Note that in order to install Insiders , you'll need to become a sponsor , create a personal access token 1 , and set the GH_TOKEN environment variable to the token's value. with docker \u00b6 The official Docker image is a great way to get up and running in a few minutes, as it comes with all dependencies pre-installed. Pull the image for the latest version with: Material for MkDocs docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material Insiders docker login -u ${GH_USERNAME} -p ${GH_TOKEN} ghcr.io docker pull ghcr.io/squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders The mkdocs executable is provided as an entry point and serve is the default command. If you're not familiar with Docker don't worry, we have you covered in the following sections. The following plugins are bundled with the Docker image: mkdocs-minify-plugin mkdocs-redirects Note that in order to install Insiders , you'll need to become a sponsor , create a personal access token 2 , and set the GH_TOKEN environment variable to the token's value. How to add plugins to the Docker image? Material for MkDocs bundles useful and common plugins while trying not to blow up the size of the official image. If the plugin you want to use is not included, create a new Dockerfile and extend the official Docker image with your custom installation routine: FROM squidfunk/mkdocs-material RUN pip install ... Next, you can build the image with the following command: docker build -t squidfunk/mkdocs-material . The new image can be used exactly like the official image. with git \u00b6 Material for MkDocs can be directly used from GitHub by cloning the repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you want to use the very latest version: Material for MkDocs git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git Insiders git clone git@github.com:squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git mkdocs-material The theme will reside in the folder mkdocs-material/material . When cloning from git , you must install all required dependencies yourself: pip install -r mkdocs-material/requirements.txt Note that in order to install Insiders , you'll need to become a sponsor . In order to use pip to install from the private repository over HTTPS, the personal access token requires the repo scope. The creation and usage of an access token is only necessary when installing Insiders over HTTPS, which is the recommended way when building from within a CI/CD workflow, e.g. using GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages . \u21a9 If you want to use docker to pull the private Docker image from the GitHub Container Registry , the personal access token requires the read:packages scope. Note that you need to login before pulling the Docker image. As an example, see the publish workflow of the Material for MkDocs repository.

How to add plugins to the Docker image? Material for MkDocs bundles useful and common plugins while trying not to blow up the size of the official image. If the plugin you want to use is not included, create a new Dockerfile and extend the official Docker image with your custom installation routine: FROM squidfunk/mkdocs-material RUN pip install ...

When cloning from git , you must install all required dependencies yourself: pip install -r mkdocs-material/requirements.txt Note that in order to install Insiders , you'll need to become a sponsor . In order to use pip to install from the private repository over HTTPS, the personal access token requires the repo scope. The creation and usage of an access token is only necessary when installing Insiders over HTTPS, which is the recommended way when building from within a CI/CD workflow, e.g. using GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages . \u21a9 If you want to use docker to pull the private Docker image from the GitHub Container Registry , the personal access token requires the read:packages scope.

Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. All new features are implemented behind feature flags; all configuration changes are backward-compatible. This means that your users will be able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, it can be built with Insiders (e.g. as part of GitHub Actions). Thus, it's recommended to install Insiders only in CI, as you don't want to expose your GH_TOKEN to users. Terms \u00b6 We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Insiders under the same terms and conditions? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle, which ends at the 22 nd of a month for monthly sponsorships. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable. \u21a9","title":"<span hidden>Insiders</span> :logo: :material-plus: :octicons-heart-fill-24:{: .tx-heart }"},{"location":"insiders%202/#insiders","text":"Material for MkDocs uses the sponsorware release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders .

As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable. \u21a9","title":"Terms"},{"location":"license/","text":"License \u00b6 MIT License --8\u2190 \"LICENSE\"","title":"License"},{"location":"license/#license","text":"MIT License --8\u2190 \"LICENSE\"","title":"License"},{"location":"my-document/","text":"Github \u00b6 Github \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uacc4\uc815 \ubcc0\uacbd \u00b6 git config user.name git config user.email git config --global user.name ngenebio git config --global user.email <user email> \uad8c\ud55c \ubcc0\uacbd git clone git@github.com:squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git mkdocs-material","title":"Github"},{"location":"my-document/#github","text":"","title":"Github"},{"location":"my-document/#github_1","text":"git config user.name git config user.email git config --global user.name ngenebio git config --global user.email <user email> \uad8c\ud55c \ubcc0\uacbd git clone git@github.com:squidfunk/mkdocs-material-insiders.git mkdocs-material","title":"Github \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uacc4\uc815 \ubcc0\uacbd"},{"location":"overview/","text":"\ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uae30 \u00b6 \ucf54\ub529 \ucee8\ubca4\uc158 (Coding Convention) \u00b6 Python\uc740 PEP (Python Enhance Proposal) 8\uc744 \ub530\ub978\ub2e4.

Error: Unrecognised theme 'material'. # => ... # => ConfigurationError: Aborted with 1 Configuration Errors! If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. brew or apt-get ) and Material for MkDocs through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks its install location for themes. Inadequate permissions \u00b6 Operating systems: Error: Permission denied pip install mkdocs-material # => Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '...' # => Consider using the --user option or check the permissions. When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are three possible solutions for this, the recommended one of which is to use virtual environments: Virtual environments If you're installing Material for MkDocs with pip , the easiest way to make sure that you end up with the correct versions and without any incompatibility problems between packages it to use a virtual environment . First, ensure that you have a Python version of 3 or higher installed: python --version If you're good to go, create and activate a virtual environment with: python -m venv venv source ./venv/bin/activate Note that the second venv is the name of the folder where to create the virtual environment \u2013 you may choose it as you like. Your terminal should now print (venv) before the prompt and the python executable should be located inside the folder you just created.

When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are three possible solutions for this, the recommended one of which is to use virtual environments: Virtual environments If you're installing Material for MkDocs with pip , the easiest way to make sure that you end up with the correct versions and without any incompatibility problems between packages it to use a virtual environment . First, ensure that you have a Python version of 3 or higher installed: python --version If you're good to go, create and activate a virtual environment with: python -m venv venv source ./venv/bin/activate Note that the second venv is the name of the folder where to create the virtual environment \u2013 you may choose it as you like. Your terminal should now print (venv) before the prompt and the python executable should be located inside the folder you just created.

All reads are compared to each of the candidate haplotypes via ungapped alignment, and a read \u2018vote\u2019 for each read is assigned to the candidate with best match. Ties between candidates are resolved by splitting the read vote, weighted by the number of reads already supporting each haplotype. This process is iterated until a \u2018winning\u2019 haplotype is selected. Aligning candidates against the reference genome to report alteration calls.

The minor allele frequency profile is obtained from the heterozygous genome-wide SNPs. Twenty (20) replicates were assessed for each dilution level, except 20%, which examined fourteen (14) replicates. Ninety-four (94) replicates were tested per sample. Each specimen was evaluated close to the minimum input requirements of the assay (50 ng), representing the most challenging evaluation of rearrangement detection. LoDs were determined based on tumor purity and reads using the empirical hit rate method for NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 Empirical hit rate approach was used when there were less than three hit rate levels. The LoD is defined as the lowest level (tumor purity or reads) with at least 95% detection. A summary of the LoD results based on reads and tumor purity using the empirical hit rate method for NTRK gene alteration in each sample evaluated are shown in Table 22. The final LoD for each NTRK gene fusion presented was determined as the highest LoD observed per gene. The LoD for each gene are: NTRK1 fusion: 12.10% tumor purity and 24.55 for chimeric reads NTRK2 fusion: 11.50% tumor purity and 24.16 for chimeric reads NTRK3 fusion: 6.10 % tumor purity and 14.65 for chimeric reads Given the limited number of samples with NTRK1 and NTRK2 fusions evaluated to determine the assay LoD, a post-market study is planned with additional NTRK1 and NTRK2 fusions samples Limit of Blank (LoB) \u00b6 Analytical Sensitivity \u2013 Tumor Purity \u00b6 F1CDx\uc758 \uacac\uace0\uc131(robustness)\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd5c\uc18c \uc885\uc591 \ubd84\uc728(tumor fraction) \ud3c9\uac00 6\uac1c\uc758 \ub808\ubca8\uc758 tumor content\uc5d0 \ub808\ubca8\ub2f9 13\ud68c \ubc18\ubcf5 \ucd1d 78 per sample ALK fusion\uacfc ERBB2 amplification\uc758 CDx \ubc14\uc774\uc624\ub9c8\ucee4\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \uacb0\uc815 CLSI EP17-A2 CLSI EP17-A2 : Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute\uc758 \uac80\ucd9c\ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uac15\ub3c4 \uce21\uc815 \uac00\uc774\ub4dc \uacf5\uc2dc\ub8cc \uacf5\uc2dc\ub8cc (blank sample)\ub780 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\uc9c8\uc774 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2dc\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740\uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8 \ubd84\uc11d \ud2b9\uc774\ub3c4 \u00b6 \uac04\uc12d \ubb3c\uc9c8 (Interfering Substances) In silico Analysis \u2013 Hybrid Capture Bait Specificity Carryover/Cross-Contamination \u00b6 Precision and Reproducibility \u00b6 Intermediate Precision NTRK\u00bd/3 \uc735\ud569 \uac80\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c F1CDx\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5 \ud2b9\uc11c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uace0\ud615\uc554 \ud658\uc790 7 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0 \uc815\ubc00\ub3c4\ub294 50ng\uc5d0 \uac00\uae4c\uc6b4 DNA input\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00 \ud3c9\uac00 \uc0d8\ud50c\ub4e4\uc740 17.2% ~40.1%\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uacc4\uc0b0\ub41c \uc885\uc591 purity (computational tumor purity) \ud1b5\uacfc\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 \ucef7\uc624\ud504\ub294 20% \uc815\ub3c4\ub85c \uc815\ubc00 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c \uc0d8\ud50c\uc5d0\ub294 F1CDx \uac80\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c 20% \uadfc\ucc98\uc758 tumor purity \uc0d8\ud50c\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc758 chimeric read\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 8.48~159.04 Fold LoD \uae30\ubc18 chimeric read\ub294 0.58 xLoD ~ 10.86 xLoD Site-to-Site reproducibility \ubaa8\ub9ac\uc2a4\ube4c \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc7ac\ud604\uc131 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 NTRK \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc218\ud589\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc74c Site-to-site \uc7ac\ud604\uc131\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 post-market study\ub85c \uc81c\uacf5\ub420 \uc608\uc815 Computational tumor purity Computational tumor purity NTRK \ubcc0\uc774 QC metric \u00b6 NTRK\u00bd/3 rearragement\ub97c \uc704\ud55c coverage analysis \uae30\ubc18 real-world data F1CDx \uc2b9\uc778 \ud6c4 76,597 \uc0d8\ud50c\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9 Median exon coverage\ub294 900x \uadfc\ucc98\ub85c QC \uae30\uc900\uc778 250x \uc774\uc0c1\uc784 Post-DNA extraction QC metrix (LC DNA yield, HC DNA yield, median exon coverage, % target 100x coverage) NTRK Bait set \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\uc758 In-silico \ud3c9\uac00 \u00b6 DX1 baitset\uc740 NTRK\u00bd/3\uc758 coding \uc601\uc5ed, NTRK1 (introns 8,9,10,11), NTRK2 (intron 12)\ub97c \ucee4\ubc84 NTRK1 intron 8\uacfc NTRK2 intron 12\ub294 not fully baited NTRK3 intron\uc740 \ube44\ub85d \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc, NTRK3\uc758 \ud754\ud55c ETV6\ub294 ETV6-NTRK3 fusion (ETV6 introns 5,6)\uc744 \uc704\ud574 baited ETV6\uc758 intron 5\ub294 not fully baited ETV6 intron 4\ub294 not having baits In-silico \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574 12,464 \uc784\uc0c1 \uac80\uccb4\ub85c NTRK\uc758 \ucee4\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uacc4\uc0b0 \ud0c0\uac9f \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\uacb0\uacfc median exon coverage\ub294 >250x in >99% NTRK1 intron 8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\ubd84\uc801\uc73c\ub85c coverage \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub294 partially baited\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac83\uc784 DNA \uac80\uc0ac \uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \ud655\uc2e4\ud788 bait\uc5d0 intron\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd10\uc11c DNA \uac80\uc0ac\uc784\uc774 \ud655\uc2e4\ud568 Reagent Lot \uad50\ud658\uc131 \u00b6 Stability \u00b6 Reagent Stability DNA Stabilit FFPE Slide Stability \uc77c\ubc18 \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc2e4 \uc7a5\ube44 \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc57d \ud3c9\uac00 \u00b6 Guard banding/Robustness \u00b6 Tissue Comparability \u00b6 NTRK \ubcc0\uc774 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c In-silico \ud3c9\uac00 \u00b6 A study analyzing F1CDx assay data was conducted to provide coverage analysis based on real-world data to support the pan-tumor indication for NTRK\u00bd/3 rearrangements. Since F1CDx\u2019s approval, 76,597 samples have been processed by the DX1 baitset used by F1CDx for the most prevalent NTRK tumor specimen sites listed in Figure 1. An in-silico analysis was performed to present median exon coverage across these tumor specimen sites. Figure 1 and Table 26 show median exon coverage for all tumor specimen sites to be around 900x, which is above the quality control (QC) threshold of 250x. Table 26 summarizes critical post-DNA extraction QC metrics, namely, the mean of LC DNA yield, HC DNA yield, median exon coverage, % target 100X coverage, and the pass rate for the 15 different biopsy specimen sites.","title":"Nonclinical Studies"},{"location":"foundation/nonclinical-studies/#nonclinical-studies","text":"\uc131\ub2a5 \ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \uad11\ubc94\uc704\ud55c FFPE \uc870\uc9c1 \uc720\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \ud30c\uc0dd\ub41c DNA\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud655\ub9bd\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

sequence reads by dividing read depth by that of a process-matched normal control, followed by a GC-content bias correction using Loess regression. The minor allele frequency profile is obtained from the heterozygous genome-wide SNPs. Twenty (20) replicates were assessed for each dilution level, except 20%, which examined fourteen (14) replicates. Ninety-four (94) replicates were tested per sample. Each specimen was evaluated close to the minimum input requirements of the assay (50 ng), representing the most challenging evaluation of rearrangement detection. LoDs were determined based on tumor purity and reads using the empirical hit rate method for NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 Empirical hit rate approach was used when there were less than three hit rate levels. The LoD is defined as the lowest level (tumor purity or reads) with at least 95% detection. A summary of the LoD results based on reads and tumor purity using the empirical hit rate method for NTRK gene alteration in each sample evaluated are shown in Table 22. The final LoD for each NTRK gene fusion presented was determined as the highest LoD observed per gene. The LoD for each gene are: NTRK1 fusion: 12.10% tumor purity and 24.55 for chimeric reads NTRK2 fusion: 11.50% tumor purity and 24.16 for chimeric reads NTRK3 fusion: 6.10 % tumor purity and 14.65 for chimeric reads Given the limited number of samples with NTRK1 and NTRK2 fusions evaluated to determine the assay LoD, a post-market study is planned with additional NTRK1 and NTRK2 fusions

study analyzing F1CDx assay data was conducted to provide coverage analysis based on real-world data to support the pan-tumor indication for NTRK\u00bd/3 rearrangements. Since F1CDx\u2019s approval, 76,597 samples have been processed by the DX1 baitset used by F1CDx for the most prevalent NTRK tumor specimen sites listed in Figure 1. An in-silico analysis was performed to present median exon coverage across these tumor specimen sites. Figure 1 and Table 26 show median exon coverage for all tumor specimen sites to be around 900x, which is above the quality control (QC) threshold of 250x. Table 26 summarizes critical post-DNA extraction QC metrics, namely, the mean of LC DNA yield, HC DNA yield, median exon coverage, % target 100X coverage, and the pass rate for the 15 different biopsy specimen sites.","title":"NTRK \ubcc0\uc774 \ud0d0\uc9c0\ub97c \uc704\ud55c In-silico \ud3c9\uac00"},{"location":"foundation/panel-meeting-recommendation/","text":"Panel meeting recommendation \u00b6

Chromosome 1p/19q Co-Deletion or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in Gliomas In gliomas, depending on the tumor histopathology and the patient\u2019s clinical features, this integrated diagnosis may require assessing the tumor for IDH1 and IDH2 (IDH), H3F3A, and BRAF mutations, as well as the 1p/19q codeletion. The 1p/19q co-deletion associated with oligodendroglial tumor is characterized by simultaneous whole-arm deletion of chromosome 1 and chromosome 19; therefore, arm-level evaluation is required.

Material for MkDocs provides several different types of admonitions and allows for the inclusion and nesting of arbitrary content. Configuration \u00b6 Admonition \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Admonition extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, is integrated with Material for MkDocs and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - admonition Details \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Details extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , adds the ability to make admonitions collapsible . It can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.details SuperFences \u00b6 The SuperFences extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for the nesting of code and content blocks inside admonitions , and is therefore strongly recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences Usage \u00b6 Admonitions follow a simple syntax: a block must start with !!! , followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces. Example : !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Changing the title \u00b6 By default, the title will equal the type qualifier in titlecase. However, it can be changed by adding a quoted string containing valid Markdown (including links, formatting, ...) after the type qualifier. Example : !!! note \"Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Removing the title \u00b6 Similar to changing the title , the icon and title can be omitted entirely by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier. Note that this will not work for collapsible blocks . Example : !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Embedded content \u00b6 Admonitions can contain all kinds of text content, including headlines, lists, paragraphs and other blocks. While the parser from the standard Markdown library doesn't account for nested blocks, the SuperFences extension adds the ability to nest arbitrary content inside admonitions. Example : !!! note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. ``` python def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Nunc eu odio eleifend, blandit leo a, volutpat sapien. Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Collapsible blocks \u00b6 The Details extension adds support for rendering collapsible admonition blocks. This is useful for FAQs or content that is of secondary nature. A details block follows the syntax and semantics of admonition blocks, but must start with ??? . Example : ??? note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Adding a + after ??? will render the block as open on page load: Example : ???+ note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Inline blocks \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only Admonitions and Details can also be rendered as inline blocks (i.e. sidebars), moving them to the right using the inline + end modifiers, or to the left using only the inline modifier. Example : !!! info inline end Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : inline end inline Supported types \u00b6 Following is a list of type qualifiers provided by Material for MkDocs, whereas the default type, and thus fallback for unknown type qualifiers, is note : note , seealso Note Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

If you wish to add line numbers to some , but not all code blocks, consult the section on adding line numbers later in this document, which also contains some tips on working with line numbers: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums : true linenums_style Default: table \u2013 The Highlight extension provides three ways to add line numbers, all of which are supported by Material for MkDocs. While table wraps a code block in a table, inline and pymdownx.inline render line numbers as part of the line itself: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.highlight : linenums_style : pymdownx.inline Note that inline will put line numbers next to the actual code, which means that they will be included when selecting text with the cursor or copying a code block to the clipboard. Thus, the usage of table or pymdownx.inline is recommended. Material for MkDocs doesn't provide official support for the other options of this extension, so they may be supported but can also yield weird results. Use them at your own risk. InlineHilite \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The InlineHilite extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions also integrates with Material for MkDocs and adds support for syntax highlighting of inline code blocks . It's built on top of the Highlight extension and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.inlinehilite See the section on inline code blocks for usage information. Keys \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Keys extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for inserting keyboard keys , e.g. Ctrl + Alt + Del , and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.keys SuperFences \u00b6 The SuperFences extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows for the nesting of code blocks inside other blocks , and is therefore strongly recommended: markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.superfences Snippets \u00b6 The Snippets extension, which is also part of Python Markdown Extensions , allows to insert content from other files or other, regular content, and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.snippets Usage \u00b6 This section discusses how to use different syntax highlighting features with Pygments \u2013 the default highlighter \u2013 so they don't apply when using a JavaScript syntax highlighter. Specifying the language \u00b6 Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add code highlighting to those blocks, add the language short name directly after the opening block. See the list of available lexers to find the short name for a given language. Example : ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result : import tensorflow as tf Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by using the linenums=\"<start>\" option directly after the short name, whereas <start> represents the starting line number. A code block can start from a line number other than 1 , which allows splitting large code blocks for readability. Example : ``` python linenums=\"1\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language short name. Note that line counts start at 1 , regardless of the starting line number specified as part of linenums . Example : ``` python hl_lines=\"2 3\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting inline code blocks \u00b6 When InlineHilite is enabled, inline code blocks can be highlighted by prefixing them with a shebang-like sequence, i.e. #! , directly followed by the language short name . Example : The `#!python range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Result : The range () function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Adding keyboard keys \u00b6 When Keys is enabled, keyboard keys can be rendered with a simple syntax. Consult the Python Markdown Extensions documentation to learn about all available key codes. Example : ++ctrl+alt+del++ Result : Ctrl + Alt + Del Embedding external files \u00b6 Also known as transcludes or file transclusion in MultiMarkdown . When Snippets is enabled, content from other files can be embedded, which is especially useful to reference and embed the contents of source files directly into your project documentation. Example : ``` --8<--\u200b \".browserslistrc\" ``` Result : last 4 years Note that Snippets is not limited to code blocks, but can be used anywhere from a document to move repeating content to separate files, which is also explained in the official documentation . Customization \u00b6 Custom syntax theme \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy If Pygments is used, Material for MkDocs provides the styles for code blocks , which are built with a custom and well-balanced palette that works equally well for both color schemes : --md-code-hl-number-color --md-code-hl-special-color --md-code-hl-function-color --md-code-hl-constant-color --md-code-hl-keyword-color --md-code-hl-string-color --md-code-hl-name-color --md-code-hl-operator-color --md-code-hl-punctuation-color --md-code-hl-comment-color --md-code-hl-generic-color --md-code-hl-variable-color Code block foreground, background and line highlight colors are defined via: --md-code-fg-color --md-code-bg-color --md-code-hl-color Let's say you want to change the color of \"strings\" . While there are several types of string tokens , Material for MkDocs assigns a single color to most of them. Create an additional stylesheet , and add: : root > * { -- md-code-hl-string-color : #0FF1CE ; } If you want to tweak a specific type of string, i.e. `backticks` , you can lookup the specific class name in the syntax theme definition , and override it as part of your additional stylesheet: . highlight . sb { color : #0FF1CE ; }","title":"Code blocks"},{"location":"reference/code-blocks/#code-blocks","text":"Code blocks and examples are an essential part of technical project documentation.

Configuration \u00b6 Emoji \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Emoji extension, which is part of Python Markdown Extensions , adds the ability to integrate emojis and icons in the *.svg file format, which are inlined when building your site : markdown_extensions : - pymdownx.emoji : emoji_index : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.twemoji emoji_generator : !!python/name:materialx.emoji.to_svg The following icon sets are bundled with Material for MkDocs: \u2013 Material Design \u2013 FontAwesome \u2013 Octicons You can also add additional icons . When using emojis, it's recommended to consult the official documentation of Python Markdown Extensions to learn about configuration options.

If you're using Twemoji (recommended), you can look up the shortcodes at Emojipedia . Example : :smile: Result : Using icons \u00b6 When Emoji is enabled, icons can be used similar to emojis, by referencing a valid path to any icon bundled with the theme, which are located in the .icons directory, and replacing / with - : Example : - :material-account-circle: \u2013 `.icons/material/account-circle.svg` - :fontawesome-regular-laugh-wink: \u2013 `.icons/fontawesome/regular/laugh-wink.svg` - :octicons-octoface-24: \u2013 `.icons/octicons/octoface-24.svg` Result : \u2013 .icons/material/account-circle.svg \u2013 .icons/fontawesome/regular/laugh-wink.svg \u2013 .icons/octicons/octoface-24.svg with colors When the Attribute List extension is enabled, custom CSS classes and attributes can be added to icons by suffixing the icon with a special syntax. While HTML and CSS allow to use inline styles , it's always best to add an additional stylesheet and put styles into dedicated CSS classes: . medium { color : #00AB6C ; } . twitter { color : #1DA1F2 ; } . facebook { color : #4267B2 ; } Then, simply add the CSS class to the icon. .medium { color: #00AB6C; } .twitter { color: #1DA1F2; } .facebook { color: #4267B2; } Example : - :fontawesome-brands-medium:{: .medium } \u2013 Medium - :fontawesome-brands-twitter:{: .twitter } \u2013 Twitter - :fontawesome-brands-facebook:{: .facebook } \u2013 Facebook Result : \u2013 Medium \u2013 Twitter \u2013 Facebook with animations Similar to adding colors , it's just as easy to add CSS animations to icons by using an additional stylesheet , defining a @ keyframes rule and adding the dedicated CSS class to the icon: @ keyframes heart { 0 %, 40 %, 80 %, 100 % { transform : scale ( 1 ); } 20 %, 60 % { transform : scale ( 1.15 ); } } . heart { animation : heart 1000 ms infinite ; } Then, simply add the CSS class to the icon.

While metadata can always be added via customization , some tags can be configured. Configuration \u00b6 Metadata \u00b6 The Metadata extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, adds the ability to add front matter to a document and can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions : - meta Front matter is written as a series of key-value pairs at the beginning of the Markdown document, delimited by a blank line which ends the YAML context. Usage \u00b6 Setting the page title \u00b6 If the Metadata extension is enabled, the page title can be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter: --- title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet --- This will set the title tag inside the document head for the current page to the provided value. Note that the site title is appended using a dash as a separator, which is the default behavior. Setting the page description \u00b6 If the Metadata extension is enabled, the page description can also be overridden on a per-document basis with custom front matter: --- description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. --- This will set the meta tag containing the site description inside the document head for the current page to the provided value.

Configuration \u00b6 Color palette \u00b6 Color scheme Source \u00b7 Default: default Material for MkDocs supports two color schemes : a light mode, which is just called default , and a dark mode, which is called slate . The color scheme can be set via mkdocs.yml : theme : palette : scheme : default Click on a tile to change the color scheme : default slate var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-scheme]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { var attr = this.getAttribute(\"data-md-color-scheme\") document.body.setAttribute(\"data-md-color-scheme\", attr) var name = document.querySelector(\"#__code_0 code span:nth-child(7)\") name.textContent = attr }) }) The color scheme can also be set based on user preference , which makes use of the prefers-color-scheme media query, by setting the value in mkdocs.yml to preference : theme : palette : scheme : preference Primary color Source \u00b7 Default: indigo The primary color is used for the header, the sidebar, text links and several other components. In order to change the primary color, set the following value in mkdocs.yml to a valid color name: theme : palette : primary : indigo Click on a tile to change the primary color : red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange brown grey blue grey black white var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-primary]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { var attr = this.getAttribute(\"data-md-color-primary\") document.body.setAttribute(\"data-md-color-primary\", attr) var name = document.querySelector(\"#__code_2 code span:nth-child(7)\") name.textContent = attr.replace(\"-\", \" \") }) }) Accent color Source \u00b7 Default: indigo The accent color is used to denote elements that can be interacted with, e.g. hovered links, buttons and scrollbars. It can be changed in mkdocs.yml by choosing a valid color name: theme : palette : accent : indigo Click on a tile to change the accent color : .md-typeset button[data-md-color-accent] > code { background-color: var(--md-code-bg-color); color: var(--md-accent-fg-color); } red pink purple deep purple indigo blue light blue cyan teal green light green lime yellow amber orange deep orange var buttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button[data-md-color-accent]\") buttons.forEach(function(button) { button.addEventListener(\"click\", function() { var attr = this.getAttribute(\"data-md-color-accent\") document.body.setAttribute(\"data-md-color-accent\", attr) var name = document.querySelector(\"#__code_3 code span:nth-child(7)\") name.textContent = attr.replace(\"-\", \" \") }) }) Accessibility \u2013 not all color combinations work well With 2 (color schemes) x 21 (primary colors) x 17 (accent color) = 714 combinations, it's impossible to ensure that all configurations provide a good user experience (e.g. yellow on light background ).

Customization \u00b6 Custom colors \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Material for MkDocs implements colors using CSS variables (custom properties). If you want to customize the colors beyond the palette (e.g. to use your brand-specific colors), you can add an additional stylesheet and tweak the values of the CSS variables.

Material for MkDocs provides a multitude of options to configure the behavior of navigational elements, including tabs and sections , and its flag-ship feature: instant loading . Configuration \u00b6 Instant loading \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When instant loading is enabled, clicks on all internal links will be intercepted and dispatched via XHR without fully reloading the page. It can be enabled via mkdocs.yml with: theme : features : - navigation.instant The resulting page is parsed and injected and all event handlers and components are rebound automatically. This means that Material for MkDocs behaves like a Single Page Application , which is especially useful for large documentation sites that come with a massive search index, as the search index will now remain intact in-between document switches. Material for MkDocs is the only MkDocs theme offering this feature. Navigation tabs \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When tabs are enabled, top-level sections are rendered in a menu layer below the header for viewports above 1220px , but remain as-is on mobile. 1 They can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.tabs With tabs Without tabs Sticky navigation tabs Source \u00b7 Feature flag \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only When sticky tabs are enabled, navigation tabs will lock below the header and always remain visible when scrolling down. Just add the following two feature flags to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.tabs - navigation.tabs.sticky With sticky tabs Without sticky tabs Navigation sections \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When sections are enabled, top-level sections are rendered as groups in the sidebar for viewports above 1220px , but remain as-is on mobile. They can also be enabled via mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.sections With sections Without sections Both feature flags, tabs and sections , can be combined with each other. If both feature flags are enabled, sections are rendered for level 2 navigation items. Navigation expansion \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When expansion is enabled, the left sidebar will expand all collapsible subsections by default, so the user doesn't have to open subsections manually. It can be enabled via mkdocs.yml with: theme : features : - navigation.expand With expansion Without expansion Table of contents \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension The Table of contents extension, which is part of the standard Markdown library, provides some options that are supported by Material for MkDocs to customize its appearance: permalink Default: false \u2013 This option adds an anchor link containing the paragraph symbol \u00b6 or another custom symbol at the end of each headline, exactly like on the page you're currently viewing, which Material for MkDocs will make appear on hover: \u00b6 markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : true \u2693\ufe0e markdown_extensions : - toc : permalink : \u2693\ufe0e slugify Default: headerid.slugify \u2013 This option allows for customization of the slug function. For some languages, the default may not produce good and readable identifiers \u2013 consider using another slug function like for example those from Python Markdown Extensions : Unicode markdown_extensions : - toc : slugify : !!python/name:pymdownx.slugs.uslugify Unicode, case-sensitive markdown_extensions : - toc : slugify : !!python/name:pymdownx.slugs.uslugify_cased toc_depth Default: 6 \u2013 Define the range of levels to be included in the table of contents. This may be useful for project documentation with deeply structured headings to decrease the length of the table of contents, or to remove the table of contents altogether: Hide levels 4-6 markdown_extensions : - toc : toc_depth : 3 Hide table of contents markdown_extensions : - toc : toc_depth : 0 Note that MkDocs will not generate anchor links for levels outside the range defined with toc_depth . However, Material for MkDocs also allows to hide the table of contents on a specific page while keeping permalinks. Material for MkDocs doesn't provide official support for the other options of this extension, so they may be supported but can also yield weird results. Use them at your own risk. Navigation integration Source \u00b7 Feature flag When integration is enabled, the table of contents is rendered as part of the navigation for viewports above 1220px , but remains as-is on mobile. This can be enabled via mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - toc.integrate Integrate table of contents Separate table of contents The content section will now always stretch to the right side, resulting in more space for your content. This feature flag can be combined with all other feature flags, e.g. tabs and sections . Hide the sidebars \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Metadata Sometimes it's desirable to hide the navigation and/or table of contents sidebar, especially when there's a single navigation item. This can be done for any page using the Metadata extension: --- hide : - navigation # Hide navigation - toc # Hide table of contents --- ... Hide navigation Hide table of contents Hide both Customization \u00b6 Keyboard shortcuts \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Material for MkDocs includes several keyboard shortcuts that make it possible to navigate your project documentation via keyboard. There're two modes: search This mode is active when the search is focused . It provides several key bindings to make search accessible and navigable via keyboard: Down , Up : select next / previous result Esc , Tab : close search dialog Enter : follow selected result global This mode is active when search is not focussed and when there's no other focussed element that is susceptible to keyboard input. The following keys are bound: F , S , / : open search dialog P , , : go to previous page N , . : go to next page Let's say you want to bind some action to the X key. By using additional JavaScript , you can subscribe to the keyboard$ observable and attach your custom event listener: app . keyboard$ . subscribe ( function ( key ) { if ( key . mode === \"global\" && key . type === \"x\" ) { /* Add custom keyboard handler here */ key . claim () } }) The call to key . claim () will essentially execute preventDefault () on the underlying event, so the keypress will not propagate further and touch other event listeners. Content area width \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy The width of the content area is set so the length of each line doesn't exceed 80-100 characters, depending on the width of the characters. While this is a reasonable default, as longer lines tend to be harder to read, it may be desirable to increase the overall width of the content area, or even make it stretch to the entire available space. This can easily be achieved with an additional stylesheet and a few lines of CSS: Increase width . md-grid { max-width : 1440 px ; } Stretch to fit . md-grid { max-width : initial ; } Prior to version 6.2, navigation tabs had a slightly different behavior. All top-level pages (i.e. all top-level entries that directly refer to an *.md file) defined inside the nav entry of mkdocs.yml were grouped under the first tab which received the title of the first page.
